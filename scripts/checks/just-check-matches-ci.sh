# The gates `just check` runs and the steps CI runs stay the same set, apart from a
# reasoned exception list below, so a gate added to one side cannot silently pass
# locally and fail in CI (or the reverse).
#
#   scripts/checks/just-check-matches-ci.sh [--root DIR]
#
# Files (both required): <root>/justfile and <root>/.github/workflows/ci.yml. CI means
# ci.yml alone — the workflow whose jobs are the merge gate. The other workflows (PR
# title, labels, CodeQL, dependency review, OSV, Scorecard, release) check things no
# local recipe could, and are not compared.
#   - `just check`'s gates: the recipes on the column-0 `check:` line (its
#     dependencies), plus any `just <recipe>` in its indented body. A dependency's own
#     dependencies are not followed.
#   - what a recipe runs: every `scripts/….sh` path in its indented body, so CI calling
#     `scripts/lint.sh` counts as running `just lint` (`mise exec -- scripts/lint.sh`).
#     A recipe that calls no repository script is only seen through `just <recipe>`.
#   - CI's steps: every `run:` value in ci.yml, a single line or a `|`/`>` block (the
#     lines indented deeper than the `run:` key; a line starting with `#` is dropped).
#     A step runs recipe R when it says `just R`, or calls a `scripts/….sh` path some
#     recipe's body calls. `uses:` steps (checkout, setup, upload, zizmor's action) are
#     actions, not steps a recipe could run, and are not compared.
#   Both directions are checked:
#     - every `just check` gate runs in some CI step, unless it is in LOCAL_ONLY;
#     - every CI `run:` step outside a CI_ONLY_JOBS job runs at least one recipe, and
#       every recipe it runs is a `just check` gate or in CI_ONLY.
#   An exception naming a recipe that is no longer on its side (a LOCAL_ONLY recipe
#   `just check` stopped running, a CI_ONLY recipe no CI step runs) is reported as
#   stale, so the list cannot outlive its reason. CI_ONLY_JOBS is not: bootstrap
#   retires its job from an app cut from the template.
#   The parsing is line-based, not YAML- or just-aware: a `run:` in flow style, a
#   recipe line continued with `\`, or a script reached through a variable is not seen.
#
# Git work tree: not required — the check reads files under --root, which defaults
# to the checkout containing this script (scripts/checks/lib.sh).
#
# Errors (each followed by Expected:/Actual:/Next: lines, exit 1):
#   ERR_CHECK_USAGE               unknown argument, or a --root DIR that does not exist
#   ERR_CHECK_INPUT_MISSING       justfile or .github/workflows/ci.yml does not exist
#   ERR_CHECK_JUST_CI_NO_CHECK    the justfile has no `check:` recipe with a gate
#   ERR_CHECK_JUST_CI_DIVERGED    a gate runs on one side only and is not an exception
#   ERR_CHECK_JUST_CI_STALE       an exception names a recipe no longer on its side

# LOCAL_ONLY — `just check` gates CI deliberately does not run:
#   verify-hooks  asserts git runs this checkout's .githooks/; a CI checkout has no
#                 installed hooks (the script skips under CI), and CI runs what the
#                 hook runs, scripts/lint.sh, directly.
#   fmt           rewrites files; CI checks the same formatting read-only through

#   uitest  drives the app through XCUITest, may stop for an Accessibility prompt on a
#           first local run, and needs a GUI session.
