Every sub-agent this skill spawns is a fully self-contained prompt: it cannot
ask a question back, so a hole in it returns as a decision made alone rather
than as a question. Leave nothing merge-gating unguessed. The parent -- this
session -- owns every GitHub **write** (opening the PR, `link_check.sh`,
`land_pr.sh`, labels, comments), every wait on GitHub (`review_watch.py`,
`ci_watch.sh`), and every merge-gating judgment, the triage of the Codex review
included; a sub-agent only touches code inside the checkout.

**Reading its own issue is the one GitHub call a sub-agent makes.** Pasting a
full issue body into the prompt means the parent must first pull it into *this*
context -- the exact cost `cost-discipline.md` exists to avoid, paid once per
issue and again on every resume run. So every template below that reads an
issue hands over its *number* and lets the agent run `gh issue view <n>
--repo <o/r> --json title,body,labels,comments` itself, under the standing
prohibitions below. The JSON form is not a style choice: without a TTY -- which
is how every sub-agent runs `gh` -- `gh issue view <n> --comments` prints the
comments and **not the body**, so an agent handed that command implements an
issue it never read (observed: the agent reported the body's checklist as
unreadable). Give it a
two-or-three-sentence paraphrase alongside, marked as subordinate to the body,
so a misread is visible rather than silent. What never moves to a sub-agent is
a write, or a merge-gating judgment.

`{workdir}` below is the one thing every template must get right: the repo's
main checkout in serial mode, that issue's worktree
(`<runstate>/worktrees/<n>`) in parallel mode. **Two sub-agents never share a
working directory** -- that invariant is what makes parallel mode safe, and
filling `{workdir}` with the main checkout for two concurrent runs breaks it
silently rather than loudly. `{holding_dir}` is `<runstate>/holding/<n>/` for
that issue -- create it (`mkdir -p`) before spawning. The design agent is the
exception, and only because it writes nothing in the tree: it reads a checkout
others are working in without disturbing it. Everything downstream
of implementation still runs one PR at a time in the parent.

**Every spawn names a tier.** Pass the tier from `.claude/agents/` as the
`subagent_type` -- `executor`, `architect`, or `worker` -- never a bare `model`,
which keeps the model but loses the tier's effort and instructions. Which step
takes which tier, and why: [cost-discipline.md](cost-discipline.md#tier-assignment).

## Standing prohibitions for every spawn

Two things stay off-limits in every template below unless it says otherwise.
This is the full statement; each per-agent file restates it compactly in its
own prompt text, so the prompt stays self-contained when pasted on its own --
a spawned sub-agent cannot follow a cross-reference back to this file.

- **No GitHub write.** No `gh pr`, no `gh issue edit/comment/close`, no label
  change, no `gh api` call with a non-GET method. The parent opens the PR,
  watches CI, and writes every label and comment -- a sub-agent only reads,
  and only its own issue.
- **No deletion.** No `rm`, no branch deletion, no worktree removal -- including
  a scratch fixture or throwaway repository created under a temp directory:
  leave it exactly where it is and name it in the report. `rm` triggers an
  approval prompt that stalls the run, and a disposable temp directory costs
  nothing to keep. Revert a probe inside the checkout with `git checkout --`,
  or move it out of the way with `mv` into `{holding_dir}`
  (`<runstate>/holding/<n>/`, keeping its relative path). When the issue itself
  requires removing a directory, the same move does it -- or `git rm -r` for
  tracked content, whose history is the backup -- never `rm -rf`. Any other
  command that raises an approval prompt is not run: name it under
  `UNRESOLVED` and the parent defers it
  ([closing-out.md#approval-gated-commands](closing-out.md#approval-gated-commands)).

The design agent is the one named exception to the first rule: it writes two
specific things to GitHub (a design comment, a label clear) as its whole
purpose, spelled out in its own template.

## Priority research and labeling

Spawned only when more than ~3 open issues still lack a `priority:` label, or
when the top rows of a labeled backlog are close enough that the pick needs
evidence. On a fully labeled backlog, the plan's `select:` line is the answer
and no spawn is warranted.

The agent writes the labels itself -- that is the point of the handoff. What
comes back is the pick with its evidence, the order behind it, and the
blocked/unclear lists; the issue prose and the raw digest table never cross
back. In `all` mode it also returns proposed parallel-safe groups -- a
proposal, not a decision: [step 2c](../SKILL.md#2c-confirm-the-proposed-batch)
still has to clear the repository's own viability gate before any of it runs.

Prompt body: [agent-priority-research.md](agent-priority-research.md).
Fill its `{brace}` placeholders from the current repo and run count, then
spawn it as `architect`.

## Implementation (step 3)

One brief per issue. **`executor` is the default; `worker` when the issue is small and
settled** ([the small-change step-down](cost-discipline.md#the-small-change-step-down-worker)),
moving to `executor` after a miss; **`architect` when the issue is
foundational** -- architecture or a skeleton, an interface/port/schema, or a skill,
instruction file, or gate whose shape the rest of the backlog copies. The test is blast
radius, not difficulty:
[cost-discipline.md#the-foundation-exception-architect-for-what-the-backlog-builds-on](cost-discipline.md#the-foundation-exception-architect-for-what-the-backlog-builds-on).
A resume/patch run stays on the tier its first run used, and goes to that same
agent by `SendMessage` while it is reachable. In parallel mode
issue every prompt in the batch **in one message** -- spawned one after another
they run one after another, which is the whole thing this mode exists to
avoid.

Prompt body: [agent-implementation.md](agent-implementation.md).

## Review fix, parallel mode

There is no review brief: the review is the pull request's own, read by
`review_watch.py` ([pr-ci-merge.md](pr-ci-merge.md#waiting-for-the-pr-review)). This
brief is only for the findings of a review round this session has already read and
accepted for this PR. Zero -> nothing to run. One brief per round that has any, handed
to **`executor`** (**`worker`** when every accepted finding names its `path:line` and its
fix) or followed inline, always inside that branch's own `{workdir}` -- in
parallel mode never the main checkout, which sits on the default branch.

Prompt body: [agent-review-fix.md](agent-review-fix.md).

## CI repair (step 6, only on `FAIL`)

Only after `ci_watch.sh` returns `FAIL`. Write the failing log to a file
**outside** the working directory first (`<runstate>/ci/<pr>.log`) -- a stray
untracked file inside it makes cleanup skip the directory as dirty, and a
commit convention that stages everything would land the log in the change.
Spawn an **`executor`** (a fresh **`architect`** once the same failure has
survived two attempts in a row), one PR at a time; attempt 2 goes to the same
repair agent by `SendMessage` while it is reachable.

Prompt body: [agent-ci-repair.md](agent-ci-repair.md).

## Design decision (step 8b)

Spawned at [SKILL.md step 8b](../SKILL.md#8b-unblock-held-designs-in-the-background),
one **`architect`** per design-blocked issue, **in the background** -- this
session spawns a round in one message and goes straight back to shipping.

This is the only sub-agent in this skill that writes to GitHub, and only two
writes: one comment on the issue and one label clear. It writes nothing in the
checkout, so `{workdir}` is the repo's main checkout even while a parallel batch
is running -- it reads there, it never touches the tree.

Prompt body: [agent-design-decision.md](agent-design-decision.md).

`VERDICT: DEFERRED` is a result, not a failure -- it is the run declining to
invent a product decision, and its `OPEN-QUESTION` is what the step 10 report
puts in front of the user.
