# Cost discipline

What this skill keeps out of the main context, why the run count is what it
is, and why each spawn gets the tier it gets. Read it when deciding whether
to delegate a step, before changing a run count, or before deciding who reviews
a branch.

The main context holds the selection and the verdicts, nothing else. Issue
bodies go to the triage agent, diffs stay in the sub-agent run that produced
them, CI logs and verify output reach the parent through a file rather than
through the prompt. If you find yourself about to read a full GitHub API JSON
blob, a workflow log, or an unrelated part of a diff in the main context,
that is the signal to delegate or scope the read instead.

Labeling is the cheap half of this by design: the backfill is a pure script
pass with a one-line summary, and re-deriving priority from issue prose
happens once per issue -- ever -- because the answer is written back to GitHub.
On a labeled backlog the whole ranking step is `--select`, three lines, no
spawn at all. Never re-read bodies to reconstruct a priority a label already
carries; if a label looks wrong, fix the label.

## Review: the PR's one Codex review

[Step 5](../SKILL.md#5-the-codex-review)'s review costs this run nothing to produce:
the GitHub integration runs it on Codex's side as soon as the PR opens, and all that
reaches this context is `codex_review.py`'s verdict block -- a few lines and one line per
finding. That is why the owner made it the only review: a local pass (`/code-review`, or
a review sub-agent) would spend this run's budget on a second opinion of the same diff,
and the step that once ran it is gone, not optional.

What the run still pays for is the wait -- usually a few minutes, bounded at 900 s, and
spent while CI runs anyway -- and one targeted read of each finding's body during
triage. The run never buys a second review round: fixes are verified by `just check` and
CI, not re-reviewed, and the step 10 report says the final head was not re-reviewed
instead of implying it was.

Whatever the review returns, read what it covered before believing it: a `CLEAN` with
`reviewed_head: no` reviewed an earlier commit, and a review that never arrived is a held
PR, not a clean one.

## What the startup costs

Steps 0 through 2c are one `plan.py` call and one `gh` fetch pair -- preflight,
ranking, selection, repo profile and grouping in a single block. Two things keep
it there, and both are easy to undo by accident:

- **The digest cache.** Every `issue_digest.py` call inside the same few minutes
  reads the fetch the plan already paid for; `--issue`, `--detail` and
  `--body-chars` all filter data already in hand rather than re-fetching it.
  What breaks this is asking the same question in three calls -- a `--select`,
  then a `--rank-only`, then a list of `--issue` numbers -- which is what
  `--with-rank` and `--detail-top` exist to collapse. Pass `--refresh` only
  after this run changed the backlog; passing it habitually turns the cache off.
- **The reference files.** `dependency-triage.md` and `worktree-parallelism.md`
  are ~380 lines between them and are *not* hot-path reading any more. The plan
  answers what they used to be read for; open them when it says `PARTIAL`, when
  a gate fails, or before cleanup -- not on every run.

The one thing worth spending on at startup is `issue_digest.py --detail-top K`
when the picked issues' bodies genuinely have to be read. That is still one
call, and it is bounded by K.

## Run budget

Run count scales with issue count, not with thoroughness: one triage spawn
(optional), one implementation sub-agent per issue plus up to 2 resume/patch
runs when this session's judgment finds the first incomplete, one fix pass per
PR whose Codex review had accepted findings (inline in serial mode, one `executor`
in parallel mode; none when the review came back clean), one repair sub-agent per
failing CI attempt (capped at 3). The review itself is not a run of this skill's.
This session's own judgment calls -- reading the implementation diff, triaging the
review's findings, reading a fix agent's diff, deciding what CI failure means -- cost
targeted reads in this context, never a spawn. Filing a follow-up (step 8) never adds a run either: whatever found it
already returned the lead under `FOLLOW-UPS`, and confirming it costs a
couple of targeted reads.

Two things scale that count beyond the issue list itself, both deliberately
bounded:

- **Background design agents (step 8b)** -- one `architect` run per design-blocked
  issue, capped at 3 in flight. They cost nothing in wall-clock on the shipping
  path (nothing ever waits on one) and almost nothing in this context: what
  comes back is a verdict and a two-line approach, while the design itself goes
  to the issue. What they buy is a backlog that stops accumulating undecided
  work -- the single most expensive thing a backlog can hold, because every
  future ranking pass re-reads it and skips it again.
- **Shipping the run's own follow-ups (step 8c)** -- a full steps 3-8 cycle per
  follow-up, the same cost as any issue. This is why depth is capped at 1: a
  run that shipped what it filed, and then what *that* filed, has no
  termination condition and no budget the user agreed to. Depth 1, then stop
  and report.

## Model tiers

Every spawn names one of the committed tiers in `.claude/agents/` as its
`subagent_type` (`AGENTS.md`'s "Sub-agents" documents them). Each definition
pins a model alias and an effort level together, so the tier *is* the effort
setting: spawning with a bare `model` instead drops the effort to the host's
default and loses the tier's instructions.

| Step | Tier | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 2 priority research | `architect` | ranking needs judgment: verifying unblock edges, overriding the heuristic, and a wrong label costs every later run |
| 3 implementation (and its resumes) | `executor` | a settled spec with a clear pass/fail |
| 3 implementation of a foundational or design-bearing issue | `architect` | [below](#the-foundation-exception-architect-for-what-the-backlog-builds-on) |
| 5 review fix (parallel mode) | `executor` | applying Codex findings this session already triaged |
| 6 CI repair, attempts 1-2 | `executor` | a failing check with a log is usually a settled fix |
| 6 CI repair, once the same failure survived two attempts | `architect` | persistent failure means the spec (or the fix) needs judgment, not another mechanical retry |
| 8b design decision | `architect` | deciding an approach nobody has decided is the least mechanical work here, and a bad decision recorded on an issue outlives the run |
| single-shot drafting or checking from a complete brief -- several follow-up bodies from findings this session already verified, say | `worker` | no repository tools needed; the brief carries everything |

A resume or patch run keeps the tier its first run used, and goes to the same
agent by `SendMessage` while it is reachable
([implement-and-review.md](implement-and-review.md#resuming-a-run)). The design
agent is also the only sub-agent here that writes to GitHub (one comment, one
label) and the only one that writes no code at all.

### The foundation exception: `architect` for what the backlog builds on

Some issues are not "fully specified work with a clear pass/fail" even when
their body is excellent, because what they produce is a **shape other issues
copy** rather than a behavior a test pins down. Spawn the step 3 implementation
on **`architect`** when the issue is any of:

- **Architecture or a skeleton** -- a new target in `Package.swift`, the
  composition root in `App/`, the Core / UI / Platform boundary, the app shape
  (windowed or menu-bar agent).
- **An interface, port, or schema** -- a new Core port and its adapter, an error
  taxonomy, a persisted data shape. The first implementer fixes the vocabulary
  every later one inherits.
- **A skill, instruction file, or gate design** -- a `SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, a
  SwiftLint custom rule, a harness check, a CI job that defines what "green"
  means. These are prompts and policies: they are read by every future run, and
  a mediocre one degrades work long after this run ends.

The test is not difficulty, it is **blast radius**: would a wrong call here be
cheap to correct in its own follow-up, or would it be copied by every issue
after it? Only the second earns `architect`.

Signals visible before spawning, straight off `issue_digest.py`: an
`unblocks=N` of 2 or more, a `foundation`/`schema`/`interface` signal, or a
Done-means written as a structure to establish rather than a behavior to
observe. Any one of those is a reason to look; the blast-radius test decides.

Everything else stays on `executor`, which is most of a backlog: bug fixes,
removals, mechanical rewrites, config edits, documentation that follows a shape
already settled, and any issue whose Done-means is a command that passes. A
removal-only issue is `executor` even when it is `P0` and unblocks the whole
chain -- deleting what a decision already condemned carries no design in it.

Implementation stays delegated even when the main session could do the work
itself -- a deliberate exception to "do it yourself", bought for context
isolation: the diff and the repository exploration are never needed in the main
context again once this session has judged the result.

### The floor: too small to delegate

That exception buys context isolation, and an issue with almost no context to
isolate does not repay it. Below a certain size the handoff costs more than the
work: writing a self-contained prompt, waiting, reading the report, then
re-deriving enough of the diff to judge it -- for a change this session could
have made and verified in a couple of commands.

Implement it directly when **all** of these hold:

- the whole change is a handful of lines in one or two files, and this session
  already knows which lines from the issue body or a finding it just read;
- there is no exploration to do -- nothing to search for, no unfamiliar module
  to learn;
- the verification is a command whose output this session reads anyway
  (`just test-fast LocalizationTests`, `just lint`, the gate);
- it is not foundational by the test above. A three-line change to an interface
  or a gate is still foundational -- size is not the same question as blast
  radius, and this floor never overrides that section.

A dependency pin closing a named advisory, a one-line config fix a review
turned up, a stale reference in an instruction file: these are the shape. Say
in the step 10 report that the run implemented it directly, so the choice is
visible rather than looking like a skipped step.

Everything above that floor -- anything with a file to find, a module to read,
or a test to design -- stays delegated, whatever the main model is.

## What parallel mode costs

Parallel mode does not reduce the number of runs -- the same issues need the
same implementations. What it changes is when they happen, and what has to be
set up first.

**Added, per issue in a parallel batch:** one dependency install and one
baseline verify (`worktree_setup.sh`), both outside this context -- the parent
reads one `verdict:` line each. Plus, per branch with accepted review
findings, one `executor` fix run that serial mode does inline in the main
checkout.

**Saved:** the implementations overlap instead of queueing, which is the
longest stretch of a run, and nothing in this context grows to pay for it --
each sub-agent's exploration and diff still stay inside its own run.

The break-even is group size. One issue in a group means paying the setup for
no overlap at all, which is why the plan refuses to parallelize a group smaller
than 2. The default cap of 3 comes from somewhere else entirely -- rebase churn
as the default branch moves under the batch -- not from cost, which is why
`plan.py --max-parallel` can raise it when the user asks for more and why
nothing else should. Every issue past 3 in a batch is another branch that has to
be brought forward after each merge in the batch, and that churn grows with the
square of the group, not with it.

A repo that fails the viability gate costs one worktree's setup to discover,
once per run. The answer is a property of the repository, not of any issue:
never re-test it per issue.
