# Run the TownsfolkKit test suite with code coverage and enforce a line-coverage floor
# and a function-coverage floor on Sources/TownsfolkCore. The report below is filtered
# to that path, so TownsfolkUI and TownsfolkPlatform are outside it rather than measured
# and waived. The floors are
# honest because all logic lives in Core: views render it and TownsfolkPlatform adapters
# only translate for it, so neither holds a decision a test could catch
# (AGENTS.md > Architecture). TownsfolkPlatformTests does link TownsfolkPlatform, but its
# tests are skipped unless RUN_LOCAL_MACHINE_TESTS=1 (`just test-local`) — so they
# contribute nothing here, and measuring Platform would gate the build on whether a
# human opted in.
#
# Swift's llvm-cov has no dependable branch metric, so this gates on LINE
# coverage (uv-template gates on branch coverage; documented divergence), and on
# FUNCTION coverage so a Core function no test calls cannot hide under the line
# floor. llvm-cov counts every compiler-generated closure as a function too — an
# os.Logger message's interpolations and a preconditionFailure message are
# autoclosures no test evaluates — so function coverage stays below 100% with every
# named function tested (19 of 23, 82.6%, when its floor was set), and its floor
# sits below the line floor.
#
# The floors are COVERAGE_FLOOR (lines) and FUNCTION_COVERAGE_FLOOR below and
# nothing else: no environment variable or flag moves either, so every change to
# one is a reviewed diff of this file. They are raised, never lowered (AGENTS.md,
# "Important Reminders").
