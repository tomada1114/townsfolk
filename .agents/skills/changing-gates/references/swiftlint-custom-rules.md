# `.swiftlint.yml` custom rules in detail

The detail behind `changing-gates`' `.swiftlint.yml` section: what each of the two
`custom_rules:` holds and which parts of it are load-bearing.

`no_ui_import_in_core` keeps `MyAppCore` from importing a UI or OS-integration
framework — SwiftUI, AppKit, UIKit, Cocoa, ApplicationServices, Carbon, and
ServiceManagement — attributed and kind-qualified spellings included;
`ArchitectureBoundaryTests` in
`MyAppCoreTests` enforces the same boundary a second way. Its module list and the
test's `forbiddenModules` change together, in one commit — adding a framework to one
and not the other leaves the boundary enforced once. Adding to that list strengthens
the gate and is the routine direction; removing from it is weakening one. `os` and
`OSLog` are deliberately not on it, so Core can log (`docs/architecture.md` › Logging);
a test case pins their absence. Its
`included` regex names the
package and module, so a new Core-like target means widening it and the test's path.
The sibling boundary — `MyAppUI` and `MyAppPlatform` never importing each other — is
held by `ArchitectureBoundaryTests` alone, with no lint-rule twin.

`no_print_in_sources` rejects `print(`, `debugPrint(`, and `NSLog(` under
`Packages/*/Sources/` and `App/`, because an `open`-launched `.app` discards stdout:
shipped code logs through `MyAppCore`'s `AppLog` instead (`.claude/rules/swift.md` ›
Logging). Four parts of it are load-bearing, and a widening edit usually breaks one:

- `match_kinds: [identifier]` spares a `print(` inside a comment or a string literal —
  only a real call site is an identifier;
- `[^\w.]` before the name spares `blueprint(` and member calls like `.print()`;
- `included` and `excluded` are substring matches against the *whole* path, never
  repository-relative globs, so both are written to survive any ancestor directory.
  `App/[^/]+\.swift$` allows exactly one component after `App/`, because the shell is
  flat; `Packages/[^/]+/Sources/[^/]+/.+\.swift$` requires a module directory, so
  `Packages/*/Tests/` cannot satisfy it. Loosen either and a checkout under `~/App/` —
  or under any path with that shape, which `scripts/bootstrap.sh` readily produces —
  starts matching test files;
- `excluded: '(^|/)[A-Za-z0-9]*Tests/'` is the second line of defence for the same
  worry: no `*Tests/` directory is ever linted by this rule. Test code prints freely.

Matching a path *suffix* rather than a repository-relative path is also what keeps the
rule firing over the temp tree the pre-commit hook exports with
`git checkout-index --prefix=`. It catches a call site, not a deliberate bypass:
`Swift.print(` is out of its reach and is PR review's to catch.
