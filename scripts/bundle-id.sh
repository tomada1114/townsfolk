#
# Reading the identifier here, instead of hard-coding it, is what keeps the
# recipes that need it (`just run`, `just logs`) working after
# scripts/bootstrap.sh renames the app and rewrites the bundle-id prefix: the
# manifest is rewritten by that rename, so this answer follows it.
#
# Prints the value of the first PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER in the manifest — the
# app target's, which project.yml declares first — so a target added later (an
# iOS one, say) never shadows it. A YAML trailing comment (whitespace, then `#`,
# to the end of the line) and a surrounding pair of single or double quotes are
# stripped; the value is otherwise taken literally.
#
# Git work tree: not required — the manifest is read under --root, which
# defaults to the checkout containing this script, so a tarball works too.
