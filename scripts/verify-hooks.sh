# `just install` sets `core.hooksPath .githooks`, but nothing checked afterward
# that the config stuck or that the hook file kept its executable bit — a clone
# whose hook silently failed to install looked identical to one that succeeded.
# This runs at the end of `just install` and as the first step of `just check`,
# closing that gap there; it does not close it everywhere (AGENTS.md's
# Enforcement layers names it as narrowed): a contributor who runs neither still
# commits without hooks, and CI remains the backstop.
#
# The hooks directory is resolved with `git rev-parse --git-path hooks` rather
# than assuming `.git/hooks`, so both `core.hooksPath` and a linked worktree's
# shared hooks directory are honored. Both sides of the comparison are reduced
# to a physical path (`cd DIR && pwd -P`), so a relative answer (resolved
# against the current directory, the same way git resolves it) and a symlinked
# temp root (`/var` -> `/private/var` on macOS) never produce a false mismatch.
#
# Skips (exit 0, one-line notice on stdout), checked in this order: the
# ALLOW_MISSING_GIT_HOOKS opt-out is truthy; CI is truthy (unset, empty, "0",
# and "false" all count as off); or this directory is not inside a git work
# tree (git reports "not a git repository", or answers that this is not a work
# tree, e.g. inside .git or a bare repository). Git work tree: required to check
# anything; a check that is meaningless outside one skips rather than fails. Any
# other git failure is an error, not a skip.
#
# Errors (each followed by Expected:/Actual:/Next: lines, exit 1; Next: always
# ends with the ALLOW_MISSING_GIT_HOOKS opt-out sentence):
#   ERR_HOOKS_GIT_FAILED       git failed for a reason other than "not a git repository"
#   ERR_HOOKS_NOT_INSTALLED    git does not resolve the hooks directory to .githooks/
