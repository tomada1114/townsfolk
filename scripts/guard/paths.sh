# shellcheck shell=bash
# Path-shaped commit rules: which staged paths are refused on their name alone.
# Sourced, never executed (like scripts/tests/lib.sh, it carries no shebang or `set`
# line of its own):
#
#   . "scripts/guard/paths.sh"
#   if is_blocked_path "App/.env"; then echo "blocked: ${BLOCKED_REASON}"; fi
#
# Read by scripts/check-staged.sh (the pre-commit hook's "Staged guard" section),
# which classifies every staged path here first and only inspects the content of a
# path that passes (scripts/guard/credentials.sh).
#
# Only what the path alone decides lives here. Deliberately NOT blocked:
#   - `.cer` and `.certSigningRequest`: a public certificate and a signing request
#     hold no private key;
#   - `.key`: the extension collides with Keynote documents;
#   - `.env.example`, `.env.sample`, `.env.template` (and the same `.envrc.*`
#     samples): committed, secret-free samples;
#   - a bare `.envrc`: direnv projects commit it on purpose; only `.envrc.*`
#     variants, which by convention hold per-machine values, are refused;
#   - a regenerated file such as `Package.resolved`: committing one is normal, and
#     whether it was hand-edited is not something a path can tell;
#   - every xcconfig but `Local.xcconfig`: `Config/Debug.xcconfig` is committed on
#     purpose and holds no per-machine value (project.yml's `configFiles`).
# A new pattern needs a case in scripts/tests/guard-paths_test.sh.
#
# Basename matches are case-insensitive (`Cert.P12` is as secret as `cert.p12`, and
# the default macOS file system does not tell them apart); the `secrets` segment
# match is exact. Bash 3.2-compatible: lowercasing uses `tr`, not `${var,,}`.

# is_blocked_path PATH — returns 0 when PATH (repository-relative, slash-separated)
# must not be committed, and sets BLOCKED_REASON to why; returns 1 otherwise, with
# BLOCKED_REASON empty.
# shellcheck disable=SC2034 # BLOCKED_REASON is this function's output, read by the caller.
