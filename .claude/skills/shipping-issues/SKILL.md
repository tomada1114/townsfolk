  Rank open GitHub Issues by their `priority: P0`-`P3` labels -- backfilling a missing
  label from how much an issue unblocks and how far its impact spreads -- then implement
  the top one, review the branch locally with /code-review, open a PR that auto-closes
  the issue (Closes #N), watch CI to green, merge with no approval pause, and return the
  checkout to the default branch. With no argument it ships the highest-priority issue
  and then what that run itself produced. Pass "all" to work through every issue in
  dependency order, independent ones implemented in parallel git worktrees, with PR, CI
  and merge still serialized. Use when asked to ship the remaining issues, take on the
  next issue, or clear the ticket backlog.

# Shipping Issues

**Owns:** taking open issues to a merged PR and a CLOSED issue. **Does not own:** the
label vocabulary and issue-body rules (`triaging-issues`); test-first Core work (`tdd`).

**Done means all three:** the PR is merged, the issue is CLOSED, and nothing was deleted
or weakened to get there. **Invoking this skill authorizes every write it makes, merge
included** -- the standing exception in `AGENTS.md`'s "Security and human approval", and
nothing else that section lists. Green CI is the go-ahead: merge in the same turn. The
only pauses: the [stop conditions](#stop-conditions), a genuinely tied top two (step 2),
`NO_CHECKS` with no local gate (step 6).

## Modes

| Argument | Behavior |
|---|---|
| _(none)_ | Ship the top shippable issue, then only **its own output** (step 8c). |
| `all` | Every shippable issue, dependency-then-priority order; independent ones implemented in parallel worktrees, PR/CI/merge serialized. |
| a number | That issue, once nothing it depends on is open. |

A count sets `--max-parallel` (default 3, raised only when asked). A `blocked: design`
or `design=open` issue ships only when named or with `--include-design` (step 2b).

## Working rules

- **One checkout, one writer**, fixed at step 1 for the batch: **serial** works in the
  main checkout; **parallel** gives each issue `<runstate>/worktrees/<n>` and leaves the
  main checkout clean. Never re-decide mid-batch.
- **Concurrency stops at the GitHub API:** steps 3-4 run concurrently; every GitHub call
  stays in this session, one PR at a time.
- **Nothing waits on the user mid-run.** Never `rm`; use `mv` into
  `<runstate>/holding/<n>/`, `git rm`, or `git checkout --`, and defer anything else
  approval-gated to the end ([closing-out.md](references/closing-out.md#approval-gated-commands)).
- Every issue starts from, and every merge returns to, an up-to-date default branch.

## Sub-agents and run state

Spawn by `subagent_type`, naming a `.claude/agents/` tier, never a bare `model`:
`executor` for a settled spec (implementation, review fix, CI repair); `architect` for
foundational implementation, priority research, the review fallback, a CI failure that
survived two attempts, and design decisions; `worker` for tool-free drafting from a
complete brief ([cost-discipline.md](references/cost-discipline.md#model-tiers)).
**Reuse before respawn:** a resume or next repair attempt goes to the same agent via
`SendMessage` while reachable. Codex CLI has no tiers or `SendMessage`: run it inline.

Everything generated lives under `<runstate>` =
`${AGENT_SKILL_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.local/state/agent-skills}/shipping-issues/<owner>__<repo>/`,
never in a checkout. Record events as they happen with `scripts/run_record.py`
([run-record.md](references/run-record.md)). **Requires:** `git`, `python3`, `gh`.

## 1. Plan

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/plan.py --mode <all|single|N> [--max-parallel N] \
    [--label L] [--assignee A] [--milestone M] [--include-design] --record
```

Read the block; do not re-derive it ([plan-output.md](references/plan-output.md)).

- `preflight: BLOCKED` stops the run; `tree: DIRTY` is a question to ask now;
  `existing-worktrees: BLOCKED` is a stop condition.
- `verify-check:` is a guess; confirm it. Here it is `just check` (`just test` skips
  lint, the harness checks, and the build).
- `needs-design:` -> spawn step 8b now. `stale-labels:` -> run its command unasked.
- `labels: COMPLETE` -> skip step 2. `github: write=no` -> report instead of writing.

## 2. Label the unlabeled

Three or fewer: read them against [priority-rubric.md](references/priority-rubric.md)
and run `apply_priority_labels.py --backfill --set N=P0 --quiet`. More, or a close top
two: one `architect` with [agents/priority-research.md](references/agents/priority-research.md).
Re-plan (`--refresh --record`) and proceed without asking.

## 2b. Decide a design that gates the pick

Only for a design-blocked pick taken on deliberately: decide, record, and clear it
before step 3 ([dependency-triage.md](references/dependency-triage.md#deciding-a-held-design)).

## 2c. Confirm the proposed batch

The plan proposes; this step decides. Look for what a script cannot see -- two issues
both editing `project.yml`, `Package.swift` or a workflow (a `CHANGELOG.md` entry is not)
([dependency-triage.md](references/dependency-triage.md#parallel-vs-sequential-all-mode)).
Take the narrower grouping on disagreement; shrinking never needs asking.

## 3. Implement

One issue, one branch, one PR; the plan's `next:` line is the command. Take a baseline
of the confirmed verify command (serial: once on the branch; parallel: through
`worktree_setup.sh`, the first worktree alone). Spawn
[agents/implementation.md](references/agents/implementation.md) per issue, a batch's
spawns in one message. Judge each result here: a `not-met` `ACCEPTANCE` line, an
unaccepted `UNRESOLVED` call, or a user-facing change without a `CHANGELOG.md` entry
under `[Unreleased]` goes back. At most 2 resumes; a third miss is `NEEDS-CLARIFICATION`
([implement-and-review.md](references/implement-and-review.md#3-implement), [recovery.md](references/recovery.md)).

## 4. Review the branch

```text
/code-review medium <branch> [--fix]
```

One pass per branch before any PR; no re-review after the fix. **Effort first, branch
second.** **`medium` is the standing default**, `high` only on the triggers in
[cost-discipline.md](references/cost-discipline.md#code-review-effort), never `low` or
`ultra`. `--fix` is serial-only; in parallel, numbered findings go to one `executor` per
branch ([agents/review-fix.md](references/agents/review-fix.md)). Read what the fix
changed, re-verify, push, record `--event review`
([implement-and-review.md](references/implement-and-review.md#4-review-the-branch)).

## 5. Open the PR

Serial from here to step 7 in both modes. Push; no commits -> `SKIPPED(<why>)`. Open the
PR against the default branch: `PR-TITLE`, then `PR-SUMMARY`, **`Closes #N`**,
`TEST-PLAN`. Record `--event pr-created`, run `link_check.sh <pr> --issue <n> --fix`
([pr-ci-merge.md](references/pr-ci-merge.md#5-open-the-pr)).

## 6. CI to green

Once the new head commit shows among the PR's runs, watch it with output redirected to
`<runstate>/ci/<pr>.log`. The Bash tool kills a foreground call at 600 s, so run
`ci_watch.sh <pr> --timeout 1800` with `run_in_background` and wait for its completion
notification -- never a hand-rolled sleep/poll loop -- or in the foreground with
`--timeout 540` or less, re-run on `TIMEOUT`
([pr-ci-merge.md](references/pr-ci-merge.md#6-ci-to-green), Codex CLI included).
`FAIL` -> [agents/ci-repair.md](references/agents/ci-repair.md), 3 attempts at most.
Anything else -> [recovery.md](references/recovery.md#no_checks-error-timeout-and-other-non-verdicts).
`PASS` -> step 7 in the same turn.

## 7. Merge and confirm the issue closed

Run `land_pr.sh <pr> --issue <n>` and read `result:` and `issue:`
([landing-outcomes.md](references/landing-outcomes.md)). Record `--event merged`, then
`git switch <default_branch> && git pull --ff-only`. **Clear what the merge unblocked**,
as `triaging-issues` asks of whoever lands a blocker: re-plan with `--refresh` and run
its `stale-labels:` command, which drops `blocked: dependency` wherever every `Depends
on` blocker is now closed. Then continue with the next issue
([pr-ci-merge.md](references/pr-ci-merge.md#7-merge-and-confirm-the-issue-closed)).

## 8. Close out the findings the run turned up

Each defect outside the issue: fix it in the open diff, or file it and ship it now
(step 8c), or file it and leave it. Read [filing-followups.md](references/filing-followups.md)
before filing, then file with `file_followup.py` right after the PR that surfaced it
lands, and record `--event followup`.

## 8b. Unblock held designs in the background

Each `--needs-design` filing and each `needs-design:` issue gets one `architect` with
[agents/design-decision.md](references/agents/design-decision.md). **Spawn and move on;
never block on one.** At most 3 in flight; drain the queue on each completion
notification. `DEFERRED` is a correct outcome, not a stop
([dependency-triage.md](references/dependency-triage.md#the-background-round)).

## 8c. Take the run's own output back into the queue

Before cleanup, re-plan (`--refresh --allow-existing-worktrees`; an explicit-number run
re-plans each candidate by number) and ship step 8's follow-ups and step 8b's unblocked
issues through steps 3-8 when all hold: **depth 1**, the
[readiness gate](references/dependency-triage.md#readiness-gate), and
[budget left](references/cost-discipline.md#run-budget). Otherwise name it at step 10.

## 9. Clean up

Once, after the last merge, with one call naming every branch this run created (without
`--branch` it deletes every merged-PR branch in the repository):

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/cleanup_run.sh --branch <name> [--branch <name> ...] \
    [--remote] [--dry-run] [--worktree-root <runstate>/worktrees] [--merged-only] [--force]
```

Then persist a probed worktree verdict and offer the holding area in one final
approval-gated call ([closing-out.md](references/closing-out.md#cleanup-scope)).

## 10. Report

No fixed format, but a fixed list of facts
([closing-out.md](references/closing-out.md#what-the-report-must-not-omit)): above all,
any issue open behind a merged PR, any `not-met` criterion, every `DEFERRED` question.

## Stop conditions

Stop the whole run and report when: the plan is `BLOCKED`, a dependency cycle needs a
human, a merge conflict needs a product decision, the same CI failure survives the retry
ceiling on two issues, or the fix needs a write `AGENTS.md`'s "Security and human
approval" keeps outside this skill's exception (a gate change, entitlements or signing,
a new dependency, `just labels`, `just ruleset`).

Also stop on **a change this run did not make** -- a dirty main checkout no step
touched, a branch moved underneath you, the default branch ahead of the last merge, a
worktree under this run's root it did not create. Prove it is not yours, leave it exactly
as found, record `--event blocked`, and ask
([recovery.md](references/recovery.md#a-change-this-run-did-not-make)).

In `all` mode one failed issue does not stop the run: mark it FAILED, skip its
dependents, continue. A background `DEFERRED` design never stops a run (step 2b).
