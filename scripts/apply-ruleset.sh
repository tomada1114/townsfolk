#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Creates or updates this repository's "main" branch ruleset — the committed,
# reviewable definition of branch protection — from .github/rulesets/main.json,
# the JSON body `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets` (and `PUT .../rulesets/{id}`)
# accept.
#
#   scripts/apply-ruleset.sh
#
# This is a human-run, admin-only step: applying a ruleset needs repository admin
# permissions, so it is never called from CI or a git hook, and running it against
# the live repository needs sign-off first, the same as any other remote write
# (see AGENTS.md's "Security and human approval"). "Use this template" does not
# copy rulesets, so every repository created from this template needs its own
# admin to run this once.
#
# Idempotent: resolves the repository with `gh repo view`, lists its own rulesets,
# and updates a ruleset already named "main" in place (PUT) instead of creating a
# duplicate; otherwise it creates one (POST).
#
# `gh` is not a mise-pinned tool (see mise.toml), like scripts/sync-labels.sh: it
# comes from the caller's own PATH and must already be authenticated against this
# repository.
#
# Git work tree: not required — `gh` resolves the target repository itself (from
# the current directory's git remote, or `gh repo set-default`).
#
# Rulesets on a private repository need a paid GitHub plan (GitHub Free supports
# them on public repositories only); that failure is mapped to
# ERR_RULESET_PLAN_UNSUPPORTED instead of surfacing a raw 403/404.
#
# Errors (each followed by Expected:/Actual:/Next: lines, exit 1):
#   ERR_RULESET_FILE_MISSING      .github/rulesets/main.json does not exist
#   ERR_RULESET_GH_MISSING        `gh` is not on PATH
#   ERR_RULESET_PLAN_UNSUPPORTED  the API refused because rulesets need a paid plan
#   ERR_RULESET_FORBIDDEN         the API refused for any other reason (403, 404, auth, ...)
